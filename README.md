#HopOn App

A fun app that takes the user's geolocation, with permission, via the Google API to find local breweries within their area. Certain filters can be applied such as open now or if there are organic beers available using a connected brewery API. Additionally, users will be able to request a Lyft from their current location straight to the selected brewery in order to promote safe and sober driving. As a bonus, users have the option to make and save a favorites list in their own privitized account for easier accessibility if they would like to revisit a location in the future.
